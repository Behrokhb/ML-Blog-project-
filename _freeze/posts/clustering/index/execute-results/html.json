The elbow method involves plotting the number of clusters against the corresponding WSS and visually or programmatically identifying the \"elbow\" point, which signifies the optimal k where additional clusters cease to significantly improve the clustering performance.\n\nThis data-driven approach allowed me to discern the natural structure within the crash data set based on lane_count and mix type, providing valuable insights into potential groupings of roadway segments with distinct safety characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Importing required libararies\n#install.packages(\"FactoMineR\")\n#install.packages(\"factoextra\")\nlibrary(cluster)\nlibrary(parameters)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'parameters' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Read in data\nFitData2<-read.csv('Book3.csv') \n\n#Scaling data\nFitData2 <- scale(FitData2)\n\n#View in data \n#head(FitData2)\n\n#Elbow Method (Number of clusters)\nk.max <- 10\nwss <- sapply(2:k.max, function(k){kmeans(FitData2,k, nstart=10)$tot.withinss})\n#print(wss)\nplot(2:k.max, wss, type=\"b\", pch=16, xlab=\"Number of Cluster K\", \nylab=\"Total within cluster sum of squares\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Finding optimal clusters to the training\nkmeans <- kmeans(FitData2, centers=4, nstart = 10)\n\n#100*kmeans$betweenss / kmeans$totss\n\n\n# #Visualizing clusters \nclusplot(FitData2[,6:7],\n         kmeans$cluster,\n         lines = 0,\n         shade = TRUE,\n         color = TRUE,\n         labels = 2,\n         plotchar = FALSE,\n         span = TRUE,\n         main = paste(\"Cluster of data\"),\n         xlab = '',\n         ylab = '')\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=c(\"Cluster 1\", \"Cluster 2\", \"Cluster 3\", \"Cluster 4\"), col = c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"purple\",\"green\"), lty= 1:2, cex = 0.8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
